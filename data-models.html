			<h1>ARTBASE RE-DESIGN DATA MODELS</h1>
			<h2>Design exploration phase 2018–2019</h2>
		</div>

		<h2>Introduction</h2> 

		<p>Established metadata schemas or ontologies within archival or museum institutions, which focus overwhelmingly on the description of physical objects, are not readily applicable to net art. Following the move of ArtBase data to a <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/de/news/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/" target="_blank">linked data ecosystem (Wikibase)</a>, it was possible to rethink the entire metadata model for the archive. This new model carefully considers the processual, performative and networked characteristics that make net art works more than just objects whose material properties can be fully captured within a few descriptive metadata fields.</p>

			<h2>Artwork record model</h2>
		</div>

		<p>A net art piece can evolve over time into various instantiations—either because of intentional actions by the creator(s) of the work, because of intervention by institutional staff working to preserve or exhibit the work, or because of structural changes in the software or network components of the work. Rhizome refer to these multiple instantiations as variants. A key component of the artwork record model thus is the possibility to link the work to all of its variants (or at least the ones recorded in the ArtBase).</p>

			<h2>Variant record model</h2>
		</div>

		<p>The variant record model can account for a range of changes in a work’s technical or user-interaction make-up due to an active intervention by the artist, or due to a contextual event outside the control of the artist, such as a component becoming obsolete. Preservation actions like the addition of a web archive or emulation instance, which result in the generation of new variants, can also be recorded alongside information about the agent(s) who carried out the action. Variants generated through such actions are associated with the archival institution, rather than the artist. The relationship of attribution to the artist can be inferred via the connection of the variant to the main artwork record.</p>

			<h2>Actor records model</h2>
		</div>

		<p>Artworks in the ArtBase are not only processual and variable. They also operate within the context of a community-specific networked culture, emerging with the mainstream spread of accessible network connections in the late 80s and developing further into the 90s and the beginning of the 21st century. This culture is quite different from traditional (Western) archival and curatorial understanding of the artist as a sole creator of a unique object. Multiple contributors with different roles and levels of contribution, ranging from artists and programmers to audience members, as well as multiple variations of the artworks involving all or some of the above actors need to be accounted for in the new ArtBase data model. Additional descriptive information can be attached to all actors in the network, as and when needed. The possibility to link out to external authority control or linked data databases enriches the data model further.</p>

			<h2>Descriptive text and event records model</h2>
		</div>

		<p>The data model also accounts for the existence of various types of natural language descriptions of the works, which cannot be simply translated into structured data. Some of these include artists’ or curatorial statements. There are also various types of events which can inform the history of an artwork and its variants, from an exhibition re-performance to a citation in an important bibliographic resource. The data model provisions that every piece of text or event associated with an artwork is identified as a unique item in the database. Specific structured data can then be associated with each item, and also queried for (e.g. date, time, actors involved, etc.).</p>

			<h2>Preservation metadata modeling</h2>
		</div>

		<p>The data model proposes further ways to describe generation activities (such as the creation of a web archive or emulation instance) and archival plans (which describe any interventions carried out by the archive team in more detail). Additional software-preservation-related records describe specific environments or software applications, which play a part in the generation, (re-)performance and preservation of variants. The overarching conceptual principle connecting these interdependent entities in the new ArtBase data model is not any particular metadata standard, but the principle of archival provenance. Provenance here is used within an expanded understanding, wherein the archival record is no longer considered to be a static, value-neutral entity with a clean-cut chain of custody, but rather a dynamic process of creation, production and interpretation, which is carried out by multiple human and non-human agents.</p>

			<h2>PROV case study</h2>
		</div>

		<p>In a research case study project carried out in collaboration with art historian and researcher Dr Karin de Wild, between 2018–2019, we argue that PROV—a model developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/" target="_blank">Provenance Working Group at W3C</a> to express the provenance of digital data on the web—is applicable to the case of net art works. Unlike other provenance standards which focus on a single entity (the art object) and its history of ownership, PROV describes entities, agents and activities, following a few formal patterns, e.g. derivation, generation, association:</p>
		
		<p>“The PROV model not only captures the creation of the artwork, but also how various actors contribute to or influence the work over time. For instance, these may include individuals or institutions, who commission, acquire, transfer or modify the work. Furthermore, PROV-DM can capture the different variants of a single artwork, even when these are preserved across various institutions. A single Internet artwork can be included in multiple (museum) collections, (Web) archives, whilst being part of the live Web.”</p>
