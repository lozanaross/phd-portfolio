			<h1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h1>
		</div>

		<p>This project has been truly collaborative, representing partnership across several institutions and professional communities in Europe and the US. The practical outcomes of the project would not have been possible without everyone who generously shared their expertise and experience with me.</p>

		<p>I would like to thank all current and past Rhizome staff members who have supported the ArtBase redesign and made the situated practice possible by participating in various formal and informal interviews, workshops and meetings: opening up space for me to observe, research, design, critique and be a part of their community. Special thanks to: Zachary Kaplan, Michael Connor, Lyndsey Moulds, Aria Dean, and various members of the Webrecorder team over the years— Mark Beasley, Pat Shiu, Ilya Kreymer, Anna Perricci. Thanks to Ben Fino-Radin and Mark Tribe for sharing their perspectives in conversation and in previous publications, which became invaluable sources for my research. I also wish to express my sincerest gratitude to Rhizome’s Digital Preservation Director, and my external supervisor, Dragan Espenschied. Without his invaluable advice, mentorship, encouragement and support throughout this PhD, the redesign of the ArtBase would not have been possible.</p>

		<p>I am also extremely grateful to my academic supervisors, Dr Annet Dekker and Professor Andrew Dewdney, for their commitment to this project and their crucial and insightful critique throughout the research progression. I thank the rest of my CSNI colleagues for the helpful advice and inspiring discussions. Thanks to: Katrina Sluis, Nicolas Malevé, Dr Ioanna Zouli, Dr Zeta Kolokythopoulou, Dr Gaia Tedone, Dr Magda Tyżlik-Carver, Dr Elena Marchevska and Dr Geoff Cox.</p>

		<p>I have been very fortunate to meet a wide range of academics, researchers and practitioners working at the intersections of digital preservation, archiving, art and software development, whose inputs, participation in workshops, or discussions at conferences, greatly enriched my research and allowed me to enroll in communities, I wouldn’t otherwise have had access to. Although this is not a complete list, I would like to thank: Amelia Acker, Aarati Akkapeddi, Dušan Barok, Nicola Bingham, Julie Boschat Thorez, Helena Byrne, Kathy Clough, Mathew Conlen, Euan Cochrane, Karen di Franco, Sumitra Duncan, Tom Ensom, Deena Engel, Patricia Falcao, Jonathan Farbowitz, Sandra Fauconnier, Shira Feldman, Eirini Goudarouli, Martina Haidvogl, Elea Himmelsbach, Olga Holownia, Natalie Kane, Chris King, Audrey Lorberfeld, Amye McCarther, Morgan McKeehan, Colin Post, Klaus Rechert, Claudia Röck, Coral Salomón, Anoushka Samms, Tom Storrar, and Katherin Thornton, and everyone else who joined me during my user research fieldwork. I would also like to extend my thanks to the Wikidata team at Wikimedia Germany, the international Wikibase community, and the team at OpenRefine.</p>

		<p>Special thanks to Dr Karin de Wild who introduced me to provenance modelling and became a close collaborator throughout my research practice. I am also grateful to another close collaborator whose brilliant copyediting skills were instrumental in the completion of this project—thank you, Anisa Hawes.</p>
