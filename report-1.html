			<h1>ARTBASE ARCHIVE: </br>
			CONTEXT & HISTORY</h1>
			<h2>Discovery phase & user research: 2017–2019</h2>
		</div>

		<h2>Introduction</h2> 

		<p>The ArtBase archive was established in 1999. Its vision and conception at the time was closely tied with Rhizome’s position as an influential mailing list with an active community, including some of the first artists working on the internet.
		The ArtBase is also an international and diverse archive (with over 2000 artworks), 
		primarily hosting works of net art, but also including “works that employ materials such as software, code, websites, moving images, games, and browsers,” as stated on the ArtBase homepage. With its expansion in size and scope as well as complexity over the years, the commitment to preservation in the ArtBase has become an increasingly conscious effort at Rhizome. This report traces some key historical developments with regards to the ArtBase 
		establishment, database structure and interface design, in order to set out the scope and ambition for a multi-year re-design process beginning with this PhD research project and continuing under the direction of the preservation team at Rhizome.</p>

		<h2>Structure of the report</h2>

		<p>The first part of the report looks at the historic setup of the archive, its founding goals, the structure, and accession policies. This part of the report does not aim to trace a complete organizational and archival history, but rather to study which points in that history were translated into decisions that impacted the archive’s interface and interaction design.
		The second part of the report looks at the development of preservation strategies at Rhizome since 2015, which can be divided into three primary areas of focus – software preservation, network preservation, and structured preservation metadata.
		The final, third section of the report sets out a series of propositions to be explored further, in lieu of a fixed brief for the re-design of the ArtBase. It includes feedback and insights from past and current staff members, identifies some key areas of concern with regards to organizational policies, the infrastructure setup of the archive and the interaction design challenges for the frontend interface.

		<p class="about-report-series">✦ About the report series ✦ <span class="italic">This report is part #1 in a series of reports documenting the research process and practice of Lozana Rossenova, a PhD researcher embedded at Rhizome between 2016–2020. The reports trace the development of a practice-based interaction design research project, starting with a Discovery and user research phase. This phase includes the study of the organisational context and history, documented in report #1; gathering information about past and current use-cases and user expectations, documented in report #2 , as well as a review of the current landscape of digital design for cultural heritage archives and collections, documented in report #3. The next phase – Design exploration, including low-fidelity sketches and prototypes and continuing the conversations with users, is documented in report #4. Report #5 documents the final two phases of the process – Design specification and Evaluation, wherein the initial design proposals are tansformed into concrete design specifications and recommendations, alongside a functional prototype, which can be evaluated by users.</span></p>
