		<h2>Introduction</h2> 

		<p>The first three reports in this series have so far covered the first Phase of the design process (Discovery and User Research). This report focuses on activities carried out throughout the remaining Phases of the design process, as these are very much interdependent, rather than linear, easy-to-separate processes. Different sections of the report cover micro-phases such as the iterative exploration of different design prototype options (Phase 2); specific propositions around the design implementation (Phase 3); as well as insights from evaluation sessions with research participants and stakeholders (Phase 4). The report traces how the iteratively developed design propositions become both an outcome and a method of this research practice.</p>


		<h2>Structure of the report</h2>

		<p>The report’s structure follows the design process which went through 3 stages of iterations with intermittent user feedback workshops which were organized between each major iteration. The Version sections illustrate and discuss the design decisions behind specific design elements and user interactions introduced in each version. There are Workshop and Evaluation sections, following the Version sections, which include short summaries of the proceedings for each session and relevant user feedback. The report concludes by outlining a set of organizing principles, or design tactics, that emerged in the course of developing various iterations of the design prototypes, and can be taken forward by Rhizome into implementation, or can be developed further into future research projects.</p>

		<p class="about-report-series">✦ About the report series ✦ <span class="italic">This report is part #4 in a series of reports documenting the research process and practice of Lozana Rossenova, a PhD researcher embedded at Rhizome between 2016–2020. The reports trace the development of a practice-based interaction design research project, starting with a Discovery and User Research Phase. This Phase includes the study of the organisational context and history, documented in Report #1; gathering information about past and current use-cases and user expectations, documented in Report #2, as well as a review of the current landscape of digital design for cultural heritage archives and collections, documented in Report #3. The next Phase—Design Exploration, including low-fidelity sketches and prototypes and continuing the conversations with users, is documented in Report #4. This report also includes a summary of the Evaluation design phase, since it is an interative process throughout the other design phases, rather than one final step. The final outcomes of the Design Specification phase, wherein the initial design proposals are transformed into interactive prototypes and specific recommendataions for a data model schema, can be found under the Prototypes and Data Models sections of the PhD portfolio website, respectively.</span></p>
