			<h1>ARTBASE RE-DESIGN PROTOTYPES</h1>
			<h2>Design exploration phase 2018–2019</h2>
		</div>

		<h2>Introduction</h2> 

		<p>This phase of the design process explored net art’s characteristic to change and evolve over time—due to technical dependencies and performance requirements, or intentional interventions by the artists and archivists. To address the related implications for the design of the net art archive’s interface, I developed prototypes and ran user workshops to iteratively refine these. The prototypes do not aim to be finished, fully-styled mockups, but rather intentionally provisional (wire)frames for communicating new user interaction patterns, developed alongside the <a href="data-models.html">data model</a> and <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/de/news/2018/09/06/rhizome-wikibase/" target="_blank">linked data infrastructure (Wikibase).</a></p>

			<h2>Prototype navigation map</h2>
		</div>

		<p>This map sketches out the main routes a user can take through the current version of the ArtBase interface prototypes. It functions as an interaction aid to users working with the prototypes, as it explicitly sets out the boundaries around the edges of the prototype. As a design tool, it also helps to set out the priority areas within the development of the ArtBase interface. The prototype does not capture every possible interaction with the elements listed on each prototype page, so the map highlights those areas that are “explorable” and hence a priority for design and iterative refinement with other users. The following sections of this page highlight just a few of the key interaction patterns prioritised in the design of the prototypes.</p>

			<h2>Variant access points</h2>
		</div>

		<p>As already mentioned in the data model outline – the ArtBase is able to link to and contextualize different instantiations of a net art work, referred to as “variants”. These variants are accessed through purposefully designed access points available on the primary artwork record page in the archive. The access point prototypes attempt to communicate two primary points. First, what variant is the user accessing (and where): is it under the care of the artist or the archive; is it a web-archive or an emulated instance of the work, etc. Second, what is the condition of this variant: is it completely inaccessible; partly damaged; or generally functional. Following evaluation sessions with Rhizome in-house staff and external users, the prototype designs added additional visual cues in the form of icons to differentiate between variants, as well as further terminology explanations available upon hovering over or clicking on the buttons. </p>

			<h2>Archive interface iconography</h2>
		</div>

		<p>Crucially, all of the metaphors used in the presentation of artworks and variants are conventional interface components, e.g. buttons to access a new area of a web interface; icons to indicate difference in typology; color-coded icons to signal warnings; pop-ups with additional text descriptions, etc. The iconography was designed and developed over several user workshop sessions. The metadata richness icons draw on existing precedents in institutional archival interfaces. The variant typology was developed to help identify different variants based on the method of their generation or accession to the ArtBase. The access state and dependencies matrix indicators build on previous research conducted at Rhizome examining the condition of records in the ArtBase. The ‘traffic light’ system indicating access state uses a mix of colors and symbol shapes to increase accessibility. The dependencies categories indicate high to low levels of risk or damage and are represented by conventional symbols and the same color system as access points.</p>

			<h2>Artwork record timeline</h2>
		</div>

		<p>In the new ArtBase interface prototypes, timeline visualizations replace the static way of ‘dating’ an artwork to a single point in time. Instead of the standard timelines deployed in many other institutional interfaces to provide an overview of a whole collection, timelines in the ArtBase are applied more granularly—at the level of the individual artwork record page. These visualizations acknowledge that a net art work is not a fixed entity, but rather a time-based, performative and processual assemblage of multiple components which often operate in parallel. Based on currently available data in the ArtBase, the timeline prototypes are prepared to map simple data points to begin with, e.g. the date of inception of an artwork as manifested across all its variants—artist link, archival copy, etc. It is possible to also map exhibitions (or other significant events) existing in the database and associated with an artwork via one or more linked data properties.</p>
